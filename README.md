   UE4 VR Template
=================================

##Introduction

This Blupeint based VR Template is for use in Unreal Engine 4 for commercial, non-commercial development and learning projects. 
At the current stage of development, only the HTC Vive is supported. However due to Epic Games being 'platform agnostic' 
alot of the code works with Oculus Rift, OSVR, etc. so you shouldn't have too much worry getting it to work with other HMDs and accessories.
There is plans to support all major HMDs and their accessories in the future.
